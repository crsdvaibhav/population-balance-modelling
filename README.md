1. **Developed Numerical Simulation Models**: Designed and implemented a C++ program (`growth_breakage_agglomeration.cpp`) to simulate growth, breakage, and agglomeration processes for 1,000 initial particles with sizes ranging from (10^-6) m to (10^-3) m, using advanced population balance modelling techniques.

2. **Dynamic Visualization Framework**: Created an interactive graphical simulation in Python (`simulation.py`) with Tkinter to visualize the dynamic behaviour of 100 particles, displaying real-time updates on supersaturation, particle growth rates, and agglomeration events.

3. **Optimized Computational Performance**: Achieved efficient simulation of particle dynamics by integrating Monte Carlo techniques and a time step of 0.01 seconds, resulting in accurate predictions over a simulation span of 1.0 seconds.

4. **Interdisciplinary Research**: Leveraged insights from "theory.pdf" to develop a numerical model coupling population balance equations and mass balance, incorporating parameters such as a diffusion coefficient of (10^-10) m^2/s, breakage constants of (10^4), and nucleation rates of (10^3) particles/s.

5. **Validated Particle Dynamics**: Simulated particle growth with critical parameters like a supersaturation range of 1.0 to 0.8 and agglomeration constants of (10^-4), demonstrating effective modelling of complex particulate systems.
